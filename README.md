# BinderVoilaTest
Testing out using Binder (myBinder.org) and Voila to deploy a web app from a Jupyter notebook. Seems like it's not working since I don't hae the Voila package insallted on my local computer where it's building it from, but I haven't figured out how to buiild it from the remote notebook I'm doing the work in where the Voila package is installed.
